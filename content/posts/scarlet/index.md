## Early June, 2021[^1].
Extracts[^2] were failing.  Specifically, WebDataConnector[^3] extracts on Tableau Server, and more specifically, they were failing:
- on the newest version
- when sandboxing was enabled[^4]
- when the run-as user was an Administrator
- because one of the QtWebEngine worker processes was crashing for some reason

[^1]:
    This was actually the very first official Dr. Nesson investigation.  Which is to say, this wasn't my _first_ impossible investigation, but it was my first investigation _as a full-time bug detective_.  Seemed like a good one to start the blog with.

[^2]:
    Extracts are basically a way to pull just the data needed for a viz or dashboard and bundle it up into an independent package for the viz or dashboard to point to.  This means the viz doesn't need to hit the actual original datasource (which can be a huge amount of work for more complicated vizzes), but it also means if the original data changes, your extract is out-of-date.  So Extracts are typically configured to refresh periodically.  That refresh is what was failing.

[^3]:
    WebDataConnectors are a nifty technology that allow for custom connectors to be written in html/javascript.

[^4]:
    Sandboxing is a WebEngine/chromium thing where the child processes QtWebEngine uses run with greater restrictions, for security purposes.

I was looped in relatively early, both because I had experience dealing with WebEngine[^5] and because crash investigations were a particular specialty of mine (there's so many tools to collect information from them, and those artifacts always have _so much more_ information than anyone seems to realize).  And because it was getting hot, so we needed a solve _fast_.

[^5]:
    I did the initial prototyping of the Hybrid Dialog/Hybrid UI system on Desktop, which was basically a way to use a little browser window to host html/javascript, allowing reuse of UI built for the web version of the product on desktop.  I then co-led the team that implemented the feature, focusing personally on the interop layers that allowed the html/javascript side to communicate and interact with the native backend.  (Last I saw, most of that core interop code was still in place, largely unchanged.)

As I got spun up on the situation, all the initial pieces were there to lay out the overarching story, they just needed to be put in a coherent order: when the protocol server used QtWebEngine to run the WDC code, something was causing one of the QtWebEngine child processes to crash; the protocol server detected that crash, and failed out of the WDC extract as a result.  In other words, the protocol server was working fine, the problem was that crashing child process.

Simple diagram showing the sequence described above.

Three horizontal lines.

The top line is dashed and labeled "[Whatever does the extract ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è]", and it extends across the width of the diagram and ends with an arrow, indicating it continues on.

The middle line starts and ends dashed but is solid through the middle, is labeled "protosrv (already running)," and also ends in an arrow.

The third line is labeled "[child process]," is solid throughout, ends in an X, and is shorter than the other two lines.

Labeled, dashed lines angle between the horizontal lines, indicating interactions.

From left to right:
A line labeled "request protocol" goes from the top line to the middle protosrv line.

Then an arc underneath the protosrv line back to itself labeled "WebEngine code".  Off the bottom of that arc is a line to the left end of the bottom child process line, labeled "launch child."

Midway along the child process line is text reading "< ? ? ? ? ? >"

Underneath the right end of the child process line is the text "CRASH".

Finally, off the right end of the child process line, there's a dashed line (labeled "crash detected") back up to the protosrv line, and a line from protosrv to the top line labeled "report failure".

So, why was the child process crashing?

### The Easy(ish) Part
I started digging into the child process, initially by way of procmon logs that had already been collected.  We actually had a repro on this one (which was not typically the case for my investigations), but it required setting up Tableau server, which enough of an ordeal that I wanted to avoid it as long as possible.  And procmon logs contain a lot of juicy stack information anyway, so it was worth looking through what we already had to find a jumping off point.

I tracked down the last event in the child process before all the ThreadExit events started firing as the process went down and it suggested, oddly enough, an issue trying to find _fonts_.  The last couple stack frames before everything went all system-exception-handling were `blink::FontFallbackIterator::Next` calling into `blink::FontCache::CrashWithFontInfo`.

These frames told me a few things:
- I knew `blink` was part of chromium's layout code, so this was some kind of layout/rendering issue.
- `FontFallbackIterator::Next` was suggestive, just by its name:
  - "Fallback" suggested something we expected to work wasn't working.
  - "Iterator" implied we'd stepped through a number of fallbacks, which suggested a systemic issue (rather than one missing font).
- `CrashWithFontInfo` indicated that this was something of a controlled demolition.  This wasn't an invalid memory access or something, this was the system deciding that some state was screwed up beyond its ability to compensate or diagnose, so the only thing it could do was make some notes about that state and trigger a crash.

In other words, it looked like during layout, the process was trying to access fonts, failing, and then deciding the only option remaining was to crash.

Confirming this theory introduced the first wrinkle, though.  The procmon events only got me a stack, and only of the thread the event was from.  I wanted more.  But I was still hoping to avoid setting up server on my machine (besides, I've done a lot of my best work with memory dumps[^6]), so I found someone who was already set up with a repro, and I asked them to point procdump at the child process to get me a nice chunky minidump.

[^6]:
    As will become _very apparent_ as I share more of these stories‚Ä¶

And when they did‚Ä¶ the bug stopped happening.

If procdump was attached, the child process wouldn't crash, and the extract would succeed.

### The Game is Afoot
No-repro-under-debugger is always _a treat_.  That's a hint you've got a live one on the line.

It turns out, this was (I believe) my first encounter with _breakpoint exceptions_.  If you know JavaScript, the idea is a little like the `debugger` statement there, which will break into the debugger if one is attached, _and do nothing otherwise_.  I emphasize the "_do nothing otherwise_" part because that's _not_ how [`DebugBreak()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/debugapi/nf-debugapi-debugbreak) works.  Let's go to the docs:
> If the process is not being debugged, the function uses the search logic of a standard exception handler. In most cases, _this causes the calling process to terminate because of an unhandled breakpoint exception_.  \[_Emphasis added_\]

So this is a thing where, if a debugger is attached, it'll harmlessly break in; if no debugger is attached, it _hauls off and crashes the whole damn process_.  It's basically instant different-behavior-under-debugging!  I hope I never meet whoever thought this was a good idea!  I won't be responsible for my actions if I do!

Anyway, the reason the repro didn't work with procdump attached was because _procdump_ was actually handling the exception.  And without the exception, everything else ran fine[^7].

[^7]:
    Apparently, anyway.  But judging by the function name `blink::FontCache::CrashWithFontInfo`, this was pretty clearly not a situation where chromium code expected things to continue on, so it seemed reasonable to consider anything after that point to be undefined behavior, semantically if not syntactically.

Fortunately, it's relatively straightforward to tell procdump to stop handling those breakpoint exceptions and treat them like the unhandled crashing exceptions they actually are.  This allowed me to get an actual memory dump of the actual crash when it actually happened, which... didn't really tell me a whole lot, it turns out.

At least, not directly.

Digging into the code in question and comparing with the state I saw in the minidumps clarified something: with the sandbox enabled, the child process wasn't trying to access fonts directly itself, it was requesting them from the parent process (the protocol server).  That's pretty much the idea behind the sandboxing, in fact.

And the bug didn't repro with sandboxing disabled, so clearly the problem was somewhere in that interaction.

### Some Processes' Parents‚Ä¶
Going back to the procmon logs backed this up.  With the sandbox enabled, the parent process showed a bunch of file access events for a bunch of fonts‚Äîan Open, Query, and Close event for each.  This made sense if we were iterating through a list of fallback fonts, as theorized.

With the sandbox _disabled_, the parent process didn't get involved at all.  The child process accessed the fonts directly, and _only had to open the one before proceeding_.  No iterating through fallbacks.

This pretty much shouted that the problem was that the parent couldn't open files for the child.  I dug into the IPC[^8] code a bit to understand how it worked, and after a bit more debugging determined that every time the child asked the parent to open a file for it, the parent was reporting failure.

[^8]:
    Inter-process Communication, this is just a general term for code that lets processes talk to each other directly.

{{< svg_embed src=./sequence-1.svg >}}
Simple diagram showing the sequence described above.

Mostly the same as the previous diagram, but with the following additions/changes:

Two dashed vertical lines extend across the middle (protosrv) line and bottom (child process) line, with a segment spanning between them beneath the child process line labeled "repeat for all fonts".

There are two additional interaction lines, one going from the child process line to the protosrv line (labeled "font.ttf plz"), and the other going back (labeled "whoops, error").

The "< ? ? ? ? ? >" label has moved from the child process line to the protosrv line, between the new interaction lines.
{{< /svg_embed >}}

So it turned out the problem was with the protocol server after all.  I started debugging that, and in short order had the biggest chunk of the puzzle so far: `NtCreateFileInTarget`.

This function is (as I recall) part of the chromium IPC code used by the sandboxing system.  It's the function on the parent-side that handles opening files for the child process.

It tries to do three things:
  1. Open the file in question
  2. Confirm the file opened was the file actually requested
  3. Hand the file handle over to the child process that asked for it.

Somehow, we were getting hung up on step 2.  Hence, the Open-Query-Close events from the parent: It opens the file fine, then does some kind of querying to confirm it got the right file, but that query fails somehow, so the file is closed and the parent tells the child it couldn't open the right file.

I started digging deeper into `NtCreateFileInTarget`.  It started with a path to a file, let's say `C:\Windows\Fonts\somefont.ttf`.  In step 1, it made a system call to open a handle to that file.  In step 2, it requested the actual system device path for the handle it got back from that call, let's say `\Device\HarddiskVolume3\Windows\Fonts\somefont.ttf`.  It then used another internal function called `SameObject`, to confirm that `C:\Windows\Fonts\somefont.ttf` and `\Device\HarddiskVolume3\Windows\Fonts\somefont.ttf` were actually equivalent.

To make this determination, `SameObject` needed to know whether `C:` and `\Device\HarddiskVolume3` corresponded to the same thing, so it called a Windows API function called `QueryDosDeviceW` to get the device/volume name for `C:`.

More precisely, `SameObject` would call `QueryDosDeviceW`, passing it the name of the device (`C:`) and a string to be populated with that device name, and it expected the length of that string to be returned from the function.

But `QueryDosDeviceW` wasn't returning the length of the string, it was returning 0, which indicates an error.  `SameObject` didn't bother checking that error, but I like getting aggressive with debuggers, so I did: `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`.

I dug around in all the docs for `QueryDosDeviceW` I could find, and as far as I could determine, `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` meant exactly what it said on the tin.  There wasn't some weird edge case that spat out an `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` when it wasn't actually an access issue, that was in fact the error for insufficient access.

So, somehow the parent process had permission to open the file, but _not_ to query the device name for the root drive.  _Weird._  But like I said, this was a _massive_ chunk of the puzzle solved.  This weird access/permissions issue meant the parent couldn't open any files for the child, so the child couldn't access fonts, so it threw that breakpoint exception, the child process crashed, and the protocol server registered the failure and aborted the extract.  So what was causing the access issue?

### If Admin can't do it, who can?

At this point, the next important clue that had been there all along was that the bug would only repro if the Run-As User was an administrator.  Even though that doesn't seem to make any sense: administrators _have_ access.  But nothing is ever simple, so let's start by explaining what the Run-As user actually is.

When you first set up Tableau Server, it'll ask you what user to actually run the server as.  You can have it run as the default Network Service account, but there's any number of reasons you might want to create a specific user to run things as instead.  Making that user an Administrator was a simple short-cut to ensuring it had a number of permissions it'd need for things to work, so it was a pretty common configuration.

Of course, running everything from an elevated Admin profile can be dangerous[^9], so we had always taken steps to make sure some things ran restricted instead.  That is, an administrator account can run things in a couple different‚Ä¶ let's say _modes_.  They can run something as a normal user, which restricts certain permissions, or they can "Run as administrator," which means running with a security token with full access rights.  It's a security best practice to only run things as admin if you have to, and we tried to adhere to that as much as possible by running anything that didn't _need_ admin access with a restricted security token.

[^9]:
    _Especially_ browser stuff, and since the QtWebEngine-based WDC extract was running in a little chromium browser, it was _especially_ important to ensure it wasn't running with elevated Admin rights.

One of those things was the protocol server.

### Don't Worry, I Don't (Need to) Know What I'm Doing
To go any deeper, I was clearly going to need to figure out the whole restricted security token situation.

I hate security stuff.  Security Tokens, Certificates, Access Control Lists, Permission Sets‚Ä¶  It's always tended to be pretty impenetrable, and never explained in a way that has stuck for me.

Fortunately, one of the weirdest things about how implausibly good I am at bug investigations is how important me actually understanding the stuff involved _isn't_.  Somehow, I always seem to figure out exactly as much as necessary to understand how the pieces aren't fitting together.

(It's even reflected in much of the explanation so far.  "Whatever does the extract ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"?  Shouldn't I _know_, to have any hope of understanding the problem?  Turns out, nope, not a requirement.)

At this point, I shifted into experimentation mode, to start poking around at how this stuff was supposed to work.

First, I made a pair of _Things_: a _Parent_ Thing and a _Child_ Thing.  These were just minimal C++ projects/programs I could tinker with and observe the results.

The Parent Thing created and configured a security token, and used it to launch the Child Thing.  The Child Thing called `QueryDosDeviceW` the same way the chromium code running in the protocol server did[^10].

[^10]:
    There's potential for confusion here, because until now I've been referring to the protocol server as the parent and the QtWebEngine worker process as the child.  But the parent-child relationship I was trying to analyze at this point in the story was between the zookeeper (the central coordinating process that manages all the other various processes that make up Tableau Server) as parent, and the protocol server as child.
    
    The zookeeper ran elevated and launched the protocol server with a restricted token.  That mechanism was somehow causing the permissions issue that was causing `QueryDosDeviceW` to fail.  That's the breakdown I needed to understand.

Then I tracked down the code we used to launch restricted processes, looked it over (understanding‚Ä¶ _some_ of it), and duplicated enough of it into the Parent Thing that I could successfully replicate the same failure in the Child Thing that was causing our problems in the protocol server.

The reason I made these Things is that they were a _hell_ of a lot easier to debug and rev on than a whole entire server installation.  I didn't have to change the run-as user's permissions and restart the whole server (a process which took tens of minutes), I could just run the Parent Thing from an elevated/non-elevated command prompt.

That ease of iteration let me determine that out of the three things we did to make a Restricted Security Token:
  1. Deny a couple user groups, including the Administrators group
  2. Disable all privileges except one
  3. Some kind of DACL thing I never understood (and never needed to)

The only one that mattered was denying the Administrators group.  If the Parent Thing didn't disable those privileges (thing 2), the problem still happened‚Äîso that didn't matter.  If it didn't do the DACL thing (thing 3), the Child Thing wouldn't work at all‚Äîso that _had_ to happen no matter what.

But denying the Administrators group meant the problem occurred, and _not_ denying it meant the problem _didn't_‚Äîso that was the determining factor.  (And in either case, running the Parent Thing from a non-admin command prompt meant the bug behavior didn't repro‚Äîjust like how the original bug wouldn't repro if the Run-As user was not an administrator.)

I had a minimal repro demonstrating the same (or at least isomorphic) behavior.

### The Bottom of the Rabbit Hole
Okay, then what was happening when the parent process was elevated, but the child process wasn't?  All I was getting from `QueryDosDeviceW` was `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`, which was not especially informative.  Searching online did little to illuminate anything, because we were pretty deep into territory that most folks steer clear of, and pretty far off the rails as far as what Microsoft has actually documented.  About all I could nail down was that, as mentioned above, `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` meant‚Ä¶ well, that access was denied.

So, deeper still.  Via some aggressive debugging and disassembling, I started poking around _inside_ `QueryDosDeviceW`.  What I found was that one of the first things it does is call `NtOpenDirectoryObject` to open `\??`, which is a path prefix that represents kind of the root of all device objects on the system.

But importantly, the Windows Object Manager translates `\??` into something different on a per-user, per-session, per-lots-of-stuff basis‚Äîincluding _whether the process token is elevated_.

What this means is that a program that calls `NtOpenDirectoryObject` on `\??` will be pointed at a _different object_ when run elevated than when run non-elevated.  And importantly, if an elevated parent creates a security token that denies the Administrators group and uses it to run a child, and that child calls `NtOpenDirectoryObject` on `\??`, it gets _the same object_ as the elevated parent gets with its unrestricted token.

In other words‚Äîand this is the very beating heart of the bug‚Äîthe Windows Object Manager _still sees the Restricted token as an elevated token_.

This is the crux of things because, critically, looking up these paths manually in WinObj and examining their Access Control Lists?  I discovered that the ACL for the path that the _non-elevated process_ gets back from `NtOpenDirectoryObject` includes the user account (meaning the user account has explicit access to that path).  But the ACL for the path the _elevated_ process gets back _doesn't_ include the user account.  That ACL only includes _the Administrators group_.  That is, the user account only has access to the path that the elevated process gets from that `NtOpenDirectoryObject` call _through membership in the Administrators group_‚Äîthe exact thing we denied when we created the token.

| Token                 | \\?? Path | Path Accessed Via    | Can Access? |
| --------------------- | --------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| Standard              | [path A]  | &lt;user account&gt;    | Yes         |
| Elevated              | [path B]  | Administrators Group | Yes         |
| Elevated (restricted) | [path B]  | Administrators Group | _**NO**_    |

This is it.  This is the kernel.  With this, we have all the pieces we need to know the bug's True Name[^11].

[^11]:
    The True Name of a bug is what it is, how it happens‚Äîthe elements involved and how they interact to create the bug.  To know a bug's True Name is to understand its exact nature.  Knowing a bug's True Name grants one tremendous power over it, typically (but not always) including the power to destroy it.

### The True Name
When the Run-As User for a service is an Administrator, Windows launches that service process elevated.  Always.

The Tableau Server Zookeeper service, running elevated, tries to launch the protocol server with a non-elevated security token.  But Windows doesn't really provide a way to do this.  So the protocol server actually runs with an elevated security token that, among other restrictions, does not have access to the Administrators group.

Later on, during extract refresh, the protocol server spins up the WDC protocol.  QtWebEngine spins up a renderer child process to run the WDC's JavaScript/HTML.  The renderer child process needs to access fonts to render the HTML.  If sandboxing is disabled, it accesses them from the file system directly and everything is fine.  If sandboxing is enabled, it instead requests the fonts from the parent process: the protocol server.

The protocol server process opens the requested font file, then tries to confirm that the file opened and the file requested are the same.  When that verification code tries to confirm the device name of the root drive, the device lookup gives it an object path specific to the user account running as elevated.  That object path's Access Control List only allows that user account access via the Administrators group.  The Administrators group has been denied to the process's security token, so access is denied.  This causes the root drive device lookup to fail, which causes the same-object verification to fail.

The protocol server reports to the renderer child process that it could not open the requested font file.  This repeats until the renderer child process runs out of fonts to try to open, and crashes.  The protocol server registers this crash and aborts the extract.

### The Fix
There really wasn't one.  At least, not one in code.

Ultimately, it was kind of a fluke that it had worked before.  The reason we hadn't been hitting the bug previously is because WebDataConnectors had previously been implemented with QtWebKit instead of QtWebEngine.  And WebKit just didn't happen to call `QueryDosDeviceW` on `C:`, so this never came up.

As far as resolving via a code change, we really didn't have a lot of options.  If the Run-As User for a service is an Admin, Windows _will_ run that service elevated.  And there really just _isn't_ a way for an elevated process to get a non-elevated token.  You can try cloning one off of a non-elevated process, but there's no clean way to _find_ a non-elevated process to use for that, or ensure one is running.  You can't do it via a service, that's just begging the question.  And you can't assume the Run-As User is actually logged into the machine and running explorer.exe or anything, because it's entirely likely that that user was created specifically to run Tableau Server, and isn't used for anything else.

In the end, this really just ended up acting as a forcing function for us updating our guidance to recommend _against_ using an Administrator account as the Run-As User.  This was something we had apparently been moving toward for some time anyway; it's not a great security practice, and so far as I could determine was really only something we ever suggested because it was a quick shortcut to giving the Run-As User the various permissions it needed.  But over the years, we'd refined and adjusted enough other things that it really wasn't necessary, and it remaining part of the guidance was basically an artifact.

### Conclusions
I feel like this one went pretty well as a first run of the whole Bug Detective concept.  It had a lot of the hits: obscure Windows guts, SysInternals tools, disassembling OS code to rip answers out of it‚Ä¶  Not to mention, the first appearance of Breakpoint Exceptions!  And between the security token stuff, the Windows Object Manager stuff, and the Tableau Server stuff, it had plenty of the "I didn't know anything about this three days ago and now people think I'm an expert" that tended to be a hallmark of so many of these investigations.

Turnaround time wasn't too bad considering the depth of the problem (and the wait times involved in server stuff).  Subtracting a couple weeks for a birthday trip and wrapping up some other unrelated work, it was maybe three or four weeks of investigation from the beginning of the fire drill until the cause was understood and we were talking about resolutions, and another two or three weeks from there until we were turning out the lights on it.

Difficulty-wise: not the most impossible solve, to be honest.  Tough, but doable.  I'm sure plenty of subject matter experts would have known that that deny-the-Admin-group trick wouldn't work and would cause weird access errors, but that's definitely a flavor of "hindsight is 20/20".  Pretty sure that particular code dated back _a ways_.

And not _especially_ weird.  Technical and esoteric, sure; it's a good candidate for Doc-Brown technobabbling at someone.  But it doesn't have a real "Wait, _what?_" moment in it like I always love to get.

So overall, I think I'll give it a 7 out of 10.  Good first adventure[^12].

[^12]:
    In case it isn't already obvious, that's the only reason for the name on this one: it's the first one I'm writing up.

    I hope no one will object to Sherlock Holmes references as an affectation, because, well, that's probably gonna keep happening.
